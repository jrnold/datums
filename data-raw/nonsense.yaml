description: |
  Data on the number of radio receiver licenses in the United Kingdom,
  1927-1937 and the number of notified mental defectives per 10,000
  in the United Kingdom were used by Udny Yule and Maurice Kendall in
  \emph{An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics} to illustrate
  what they called "nonsense correlations".
  Tufte updated these variable with the number of letters in the first name
  of the US president for those years.
