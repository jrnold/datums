title: "King-Davenant Price Schedule"
description: >-
  The King-Davenant price schedule is a small schedule of the the harvest sizes and
  prices of corn. It was published by Davenant in 1699 and also attributed to
  Gregory King. This schedule was analyzed by Jevons in 1871.  It is likely that
  this schedule is only an approximation of the original data, since the
  the third difference is constant (Stigler 1999, p. 81).

  Jevons (1871) fit the schedule with a function of the form
  \deqn{\frac{a}{{(x - b)}^{n}}}{a / (x - b)^n}.
  It assumed \eqn{n = 2} was assumed, and then solved for \eqn{a = 0.824} and
  \eqn{b = 0.12}. See Stigler (1999) for details of how this was fit.
