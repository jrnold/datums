title: "Weldon's Dice Rolls"
description: >+
  In order to test how well probability theory represented the real-world,
  Frank Weldon threw 12 dice 26,306 times.
  For each throw, he recorded the number of dice that showed a five or six.
  Pearson analyzed this data in 1900, and compared it to the implied values of
  a binomial distribution.

variables:
  - name: "n"
    description: >
      Number of dice showing five or six in the throw of 12 dice.
  - name: observed
    description: Number observed in Weldon's data
  - name: theoretical
    description: >
      Theoretical values assuming \eqn{\theta = 1/3}{theta = 1/3}.
  - name: pearson
    description: >
      Pearson's corrected theoretical values using \eqn{\theta = 0.3377}{theta = 0.3377}.
