title: John Kerrich's Coin Tossing Experiment (Summary)
description: >
  John Kerrich, along with internee Eric Christensen, demonstrated the Law of Large Numbers by
  tossing a coin 10,000 times and recording the number of heads while interned in Denmark during World War II.
  In total, the tosses yielded 5,067 heads. Kerrich discussed
  these results in the text \emph{An experimental introduction to the theory of probability}.

  This data provides a summary of the coin tosses with the number of heads
  heads at certain intervals of number of tosses: 10-90 by 10,
  100-900 by 100, and 1000-10,000 by 1,000.
