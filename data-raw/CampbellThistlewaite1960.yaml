title: "Thistlewaite and Campbell (1960) Regression Discontinuity Data"
description: |+
  This contains the data used in Thistlewaite and Campbell (1960), the first regression-discontinuity design paper.
  It studied the effect of merit awards on future academic outcomes: career aspirations, enrollment in
  Ph.D. or M.D. programs, and intellectualism.

  Their sample consists near winners in the 1957 Merit program.
  It consists of 5,126 students who received the Certificates of Merit (C of M)
  and 2,848 students who received a letter of commendation.
  Students received the Certificate of Merit primarily based on the basis of the CEEB
  Scholarship Qualifying Test (SQT). The sample only includes those within 10 points
  of the cut-off point for their state.  These students were sent a questionnaire
  which provides the response variables for this analysis.

  The values of \code{scholarship}, \code{scholarship_150}, \code{number_respondents},
  \code{teacher_researcher}, and \code{intellectualism} come from extracting data from
  the figures in the paper.
