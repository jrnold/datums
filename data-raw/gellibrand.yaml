title: "Magnetic Variation at Deptford, England in 1635"
description: |
  Henry Gellibrand's data for readings of the variation between magnetic and
  true north using the Sun's taken at Deptford, England.

  It is the first known use of the term "meane" (mean) to refer to a statistic.
  However, what he calls the measures of magnetic variations which he calculates,
  4 degrees 5 minutes, is the mid-range of the data.
variables:
  - name: afternoon
    description: Reading was taken in the afternoon
  - name: altitude
    description: Altitude of the Sun in degrees
  - name: azim_mag
    description: Magnetic azimuth in degrees
  - name: azim_sun
    description: Azimuth of the Sun in degrees
  - name: variation
