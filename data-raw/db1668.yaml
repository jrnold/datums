title: "Table of Magnetic Variation near Bristol on May 23, 1668"
description: >+
  This is from a note published in the \emph{Transactions of the Royal Society}
  in 1668. The editor, Henry Oldenburg,  printed parts of a letter from "D.B."
  with five values of the magnetic variation near Bristol, England on May 23, 1668.
  This letter is notable in that he calculates the "mean of the true Variation",
  where "mean" refers to the arithmetic mean. It is referenced by Stigler as
  the first instance in which the term "mean" is used to refer to the
  arithmetical mean. D.B. reported a mean of 1 degree 27 minutes,
  rounding down from the arithmetic mean of 1 degree 28 minutes.
