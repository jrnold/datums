title: Correlations of length and breadth of skulls by sex
description: |+
  The data consist of the correlations between the length and
  breadth of skulls in the Paris Catacombs gathered by
  C. D. Fawcett, though neither a citation nor the raw data is provided in the article.

  This is a dataset mentioned by Pearson as an example of the phenomena now known
  as Simpson's Paradox and what he calls "spurious correlation":

  \dQuote{We are thus forced to the conclusion that a mixture of heterogeneous groups,
  each of which exhibits in itself no organic correlation, will exhibit a greater or less
  amount of correlation. This correlation may properly be called spurious, yet as it
  is almost impossible to guarantee the absolute homogeneity of any community, our
  results for correlation are always liable to an error, the amount of which cannot be
  foretold. To those who persist in looking upon all correlation as cause and effect,
  the fact that correlation can be produced between two quite uncorrelated characters
  A and B by taking an artificial mixture of two closely allied races, must come rather
  as a shock.} (Pearson  )

  The probable error of the correlation coefficient is
  \deqn{PE = 0.6745 \left( \frac{1 - r^2}{\sqrt{n}} \right)}{PE = 0.6745 (1 - r^2 / sqrt(n))}.
