title: "Price of Wheat in Delhi 1763-1836"
description: >+
  Price of wheat in Delhi 1763-1836.  This series was notoriously and spuriously
  related to sunspots (Wolf's numbers) by William S. Jevons in his
  last published paper. Jevons theorized that sunspots were related to
  commercial cycles and crises due to similarity in cycles of these time series.
