  Several Simulated Datasets Illustrating Correlation Coefficients

details: |+
  This dataset contains several simulated datasets of (x, y) values that illustrate
  different correlation coefficients. These generated in the same manner
  as the plot of different correlation coefficients on the Wikpedia page for
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#/media/File:Correlation_examples2.svg}{Correlation and Covariance}.

  Datasets 1-7 are sampled from bivariate normal distributions with mean zero, standard deviation one, and correlations of 1, 0.8, 0.4, 0, -0.4, -0.8, and -1, respectively.

  Datasets 8-14 are sampled from degenerate bivariate normal distributions with mean zero, standard deviation one, and correlation one, but roated by values 0, \eqn{\pi / 12}{pi / 12}, \eqn{\pi / 6}{pi / 6}, \eqn{\pi / 4}{pi / 4}, \eqn{pi / 2 - pi / 6}{pi / 2 - pi / 6}, \eqn{\pi/ 2 - \pi / 12}{pi/ 2 - pi / 12}, \eqn{\pi / 2}{pi / 2}.
  All of these have a correlation coefficient of 1, except when the line is horizontal, in which case the correlation coefficient is undefined.

  Datasets 15-21 are miscelleanous datasets that have Pearson correlation coefficients of zero, but look quite different.
