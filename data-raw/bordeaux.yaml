title: Prices of Bordeaux Vintages
description: >
  Prices of Vintages of Bordeaux Wines in New York auctions.
  The price is an index based on the wines of multiple chateaus,
  from a regression of the logarithm price from several thousand auction sales
  with variables for chateau and vintage years.
  These data include vintages 1952 to 1980, with missing price values
  for 1954 and 1956 because they were rarely sold.
